# distract-navi

## Reason
Testing ways to distract my overly/oddly social cat, Navi, from crying/begging for attention at night, while I'm attempting to get some rest. He's a bit needy when it comes to affection and play, and loved to wake me throughout the night when seeking either. In order to get a sufficient amount of sleep, he now spends the night just outside of the bedroom, and tends to cry periodically, waking me at random times. White noise generators, fans, and a door draft stopper have helped in blocking out his sound, but not completely. 

## Implementation
Verbal commands, especially tongue clicking calls, tend to tone him down, so the first iteration will be testing these sounds. When his cries are detected, an audio file contain these clicking sounds will be played. Next will be to play some soothing instrumental music, seeing that music calms him down. And finally, cat meows will be played, but I'm assuming that this won't work and may cause him to cry more. Whichever is most efficient is what will be permanently implemented.

## Navi Insight
Navi is a bit strange for a cat due to his social nature, as well as having dog like sensesibilities. He understands verbal commands and visual queues, follows me wherever I walk, loves belly rubs, and is overall (too) friendly. But his social needs and behavior make sense when considering he was a stray, and when I found him he was rolling around in front my apartment building begging passerbys for attention.
